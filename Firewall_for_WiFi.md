To create a firewall for WiFi, we need to import tne necessary libraries. For this part of the project, I'll import the socket and OS libraries in python. The socket library will be used to create a socket and the os library to execute system commands.

The next part would be creating a function to check the IP address of incoming traffic. In this function, I'll use the socket lirary to create a socket, bind it to the network interface, and listen for incoming traffic. I'll also create a dictionary to store the IP addresses that I want to block. It will allow me to add or remove addresses easily if necessary. 

Now I'll create another function to block traffic from specific addresses. In this function I'll use the os library to execute system commands to block traffic from specific IP addresses.

Finally, I'll create a loop to check for incoming traffic from specific IP addresses.

For access to my code and how it runs, here's the link(https://replit.com/@LarnelleAnkunda/WiFifirewall#main.py)
