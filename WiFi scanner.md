This is the most efficient scanner for ethical hacking and mitigating security risks through penetration testing. I don't have the necessary permissions to scan nearby networks but I can use "sudo" for elevated script privileges. It's easier to run sudo on a kal linux operating system for more efficient results. I'm still workig on this part of the project in terms of getting permissions
