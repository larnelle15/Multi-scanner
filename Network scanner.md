For this part of the project, we will be building a network scanner, I don't have the necessary permissions to scan the networks near me as it is illegal to do so. Since this is a research project, I've stated the ways in which a network scanner can help people mitigate security risks and now I am going to write code that would scan the a nearby IP and Mac address. For necessary permissions on scanning nearby networks, using sudo on a unix based system would do the trick. I am still trying to build a Kali linux Virtual machine on my mac but it won't install so as I work on that in order to incoperate "sudo" to my code and get the necessary permissions to scan nearby networks, I am going to talk about the step by step process it takes to build a network scanner in python.

First we have to install the scapy library, I'll install it using the "pip install scapy" command to install the scapy library and then i'll write the
