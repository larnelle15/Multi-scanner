# Multi-Scanner
This was a personal research project that I presented for my Computer Science 2(Python) class at the end of the semester. Security risk is a big threat to people all over the world today. I gave an example of how businesses are the biggest target of network intrusions all over the world, and obviously its because of the important data that companies possess that could be used for blackmail or access to their income. In this project, I will talk about four mitigation strategies which would help reduce the risk down to an acceptable level and build three of them using python. The three I will be building are the network, wifi and port scanners and I will talk about creating a firewall in detail which is my fourth mitigation strategy. I will also create a firewall for wifi in particular using python. The scapy and socket libraries are going to be my best friends in this project but before I get into detail about the requirements of building these I want give descriptions on what a network, port, and wifi scanner are, as well as a firewall ofcourse.

# Network Scanner

A network scanner is a software tool used for diagnostic and investigative purposes to find and categorize what devices are running on a network. Some of the most popular network scanning tools that people use are nessus, nexpose, Open VAS and Nmap which I have used in one of my previous projects labled Exploits where i practiced penetration testing using metasploitable. Mitigating security risks is easier when you can identify the security vulnerabilities and loopholes in the nodes of an entire network and that's where the network scanner comes in handy.
