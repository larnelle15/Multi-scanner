# Multi-Scanner
This was a personal research project that I presented for my Computer Science 2(Python) class at the end of the semester. Security risk is a big threat to people all over the world today. I gave an example of how businesses are the biggest target of network intrusions all over the world, and obviously its because of the important data that companies possess that could be used for blackmail or access to their income. In this project, I will talk about four mitigation strategies which would help reduce the risk down to an acceptable level and build three of them using python. The three I will be building are the network, wifi and port scanners and I will talk about creating a firewall in detail which is my fourth mitigation strategy. I will also create a firewall for wifi in particular using python. The scapy and socket libraries are going to be my best friends in this project but before I get into detail about the requirements of building these I want give descriptions on what a network, port, and wifi scanner are, as well as a firewall ofcourse.
